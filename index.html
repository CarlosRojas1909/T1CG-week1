                        Jennifer Joanna Aniston (born February 11, 1969) is an American actress, film producer, and
                        businesswoman. The daughter of actors John Aniston and Nancy Dow, she began working as an
                        actress at an early age with an uncredited role in the 1987 film Mac and Me. After her career
                        grew successfully in the 1990s, Aniston has remained a well-known public figure and established
                        herself as one of the leading and highest-paid actresses in Hollywood as of 2018.

                        Aniston rose to fame portraying Rachel Green on the television sitcom Friends (1994â€“2004), for
                        which she earned Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild awards. The character was
                        widely popular while the series aired and was later recognized as one of the greatest female
                        characters in American television. Aniston has since played lead roles in numerous comedies and
                        romantic comedies. Her box office successes include Bruce Almighty (2003), The Break-Up (2006),
                        Marley & Me (2008), Just Go with It (2011), Horrible Bosses (2011), and We're the Millers
                        (2013), each of which grossed over $200 million in worldwide box office receipts. Her most
                        critically acclaimed roles include the dramedy The Good Girl (2002) and the drama Cake (2014).

                        Aniston co-founded production company Echo Films in 2008. Divorced from actor Brad Pitt, to whom
                        she was married for five years, she is separated from actor Justin Theroux, whom she married in
